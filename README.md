<h1>What is NextJs</h1>
Next.js is a React framework used for building fast and scalable web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), client-side rendering (CSR), and API routes, making it ideal for both static websites and dynamic web applications.

<h1>Key Features of Next.js:</h1>
1) Server-Side Rendering (SSR) – Renders pages on the server for better SEO and performance.<br>
2) Static Site Generation (SSG) – Pre-renders pages at build time for fast loading.<br>
3) Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) – Updates static content without rebuilding the entire site.<br>
4) API Routes – Allows building backend APIs within the Next.js app.<br>
5) Automatic Code Splitting – Loads only necessary JavaScript for better performance.<br>
6) Image Optimization – Uses the next/image component for efficient image handling.<br>
7) Middleware & Edge Functions – Handles requests before they reach the final destination.

<h1>Why Use Next.js?</h1>
1) SEO-friendly – SSR and SSG improve search engine rankings.<br>
2) Performance Optimized – Faster page loads with automatic optimizations.<br>
3) Built-in Routing – Uses a file-based routing system (pages/ directory).<br>
4) Full-stack Capabilities – Can handle both frontend and backend logic.
