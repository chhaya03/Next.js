<h1>1=>What is NextJs</h1>
Next.js is a React framework used for building fast and scalable web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), client-side rendering (CSR), and API routes, making it ideal for both static websites and dynamic web applications.

<h1>Key Features of Next.js:</h1>
1) Server-Side Rendering (SSR) – Renders pages on the server for better SEO and performance.<br>
2) Static Site Generation (SSG) – Pre-renders pages at build time for fast loading.<br>
3) Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) – Updates static content without rebuilding the entire site.<br>
4) API Routes – Allows building backend APIs within the Next.js app.<br>
5) Automatic Code Splitting – Loads only necessary JavaScript for better performance.<br>
6) Image Optimization – Uses the next/image component for efficient image handling.<br>
7) Middleware & Edge Functions – Handles requests before they reach the final destination.

<h1>Why Use Next.js?</h1>
1) SEO-friendly – SSR and SSG improve search engine rankings.<br>
2) Performance Optimized – Faster page loads with automatic optimizations.<br>
3) Built-in Routing – Uses a file-based routing system (pages/ directory).<br>
4) Full-stack Capabilities – Can handle both frontend and backend logic.


<h1>2=>Server-Based Components in Next.js</h1>

In Next.js, server-based components (or Server Components) are a key feature introduced in React Server Components (RSC). They allow developers to render components entirely on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance.
<h2>1. Default Server Components</h2>
By default, all components in the app/ directory are Server Components unless explicitly marked as Client Components.<br>This component renders on the server and sends only HTML to the client.
<h2>2. Fetching Data in Server Components</h2>
One advantage of Server Components is the ability to directly fetch data from databases or APIs without needing API routes or useEffect.<br>
The fetch runs on the server, and only static HTML is sent to the client.


<h2>3. When to Use Client Components?</h2>
Sometimes, we need Client Components when using:<br>

State (useState)<br>
Effects (useEffect)<br>
Event Listeners (onClick, onChange)<br>
Browser APIs (localStorage, window, document)

**📌 To create a Client Component, use "use client" at the top.**
1) Server Components (default in app/ directory) run on the server and send only HTML.<br>
2) They allow direct data fetching without exposing API routes.<br>
3) Client Components are needed for state, effects, and event listeners ("use client").<br>
4) You can mix Client Components inside Server Components.<br>

<h1>Image, Script, and Link Components in Next.js</h1>
Next.js provides optimized built-in components for handling images, scripts, and links efficiently. Here’s how to use them:

<h2>1️⃣ next/image (Optimized Image Component):</h2>
Next.js provides an *<Image>* component that automatically optimizes images by lazy loading, resizing, and serving them in modern formats.

<h4>Features of next/image</h4>
✅ Automatic Optimization – Images are resized and optimized.<br>
✅ Lazy Loading – Only loads when visible in viewport.<br>
✅ Responsive – Automatically adjusts size for different devices.<br>
✅ Modern Formats – Converts to WebP when supported.

<h2>2️⃣ next/script (Optimized Script Loading):</h2>
The <Script> component optimizes how external scripts are loaded in Next.js, improving performance.

<h4>Script Loading Strategies</h4>
beforeInteractive – Loads script before page is interactive.<br>
afterInteractive (default) – Loads script after hydration.<br>
lazyOnload – Loads script after page fully loads.<br>
✅ Improves performance by deferring unnecessary scripts.<br>
✅ Avoids render-blocking issues.<br>
✅ Better SEO and UX as scripts load efficiently.

<h2>3️⃣ next/link (Optimized Client-side Navigation):</h2>
The <Link> component enables client-side navigation between pages without full page reloads.

<h4>Why Use next/link?</h4>
✅ Pre-fetching – Loads page in the background for instant navigation.<br>
✅ Client-side Routing – No full page reloads.<br>
✅ SEO-friendly – Works with crawlers better than window.location.href.

<h1>4=>Creating an API Route in App Router</h1>
In Next.js (App Router), API routes are handled within the app directory using the Route Handlers feature. Unlike the Pages Router (pages/api/), API routes in the App Router are defined inside the app/api/ directory using the request handlers (GET, POST, etc.) within server components.

<h2>🔹 Creating an API Route in App Router:</h2>
You define API routes inside the app/api/ folder using route.js (JavaScript) .

<h2>🔹 Handling Different HTTP Methods:</h2>
Next.js App Router supports handling multiple HTTP methods in the same file .
Handling GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request) {}<br>
 export async function GET(request) {}<br>
 export async function HEAD(request) {}<br>
  export async function PUT(request) {}<br>
  export async function DELETE(request) {}<br>
  export async function PATCH(request) {}<br>
  If `OPTIONS` is not defined, Next.js will automatically implement `OPTIONS` and set the appropriate Response `Allow` header depending on the other methods defined in the Route Handler.<br> export async function OPTIONS(request) {}

<h2>🔹 Handling Route Parameters (Dynamic API Routes)</h2>
To create dynamic API routes, use folder-based routing /api/user/:id .
